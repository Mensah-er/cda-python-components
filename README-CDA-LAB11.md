# Constrained Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 09

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-CDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-09-001 - Lab Module 09](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-10488503).

### Description

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 

How does your implementation work?

### Code Repository and Branch

NOTE: Be sure to include the branch (e.g. https://github.com/programming-the-iot/python-components/tree/alpha001).

URL: https://github.com/Mensah-er/cda-python-components/tree/labmodule09

### UML Design Diagram(s)

NOTE: Include one or more UML designs representing your solution. It's expected each
diagram you provide will look similar to, but not the same as, its counterpart in the
book [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).


### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

- CoapClientTest: 
##Tests initialization, request sending, and response handling for the CoAP client.
- GenericCoapResourceHandlerTest: 
##Verifies that a resource handler correctly processes incoming messages and triggers callbacks.
-

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)

- CoapClientGatewayIntegrationTest: 
##Ensures end-to-end communication between the CoAP client and CoapServerGateway. Validates that messages sent by the client are received and correctly processed by the server.
- DeviceDataManagerCoapIntegrationTest: 
##Confirms that CoAP messages from the client correctly update the DeviceDataManager state and resources.
